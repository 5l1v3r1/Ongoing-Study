>JetBrains DotPeek (currently version 1.2) has a very nice feature which lets you not only generate pdbs but also to serve those pdbs locally through a built in Symbol Server to provide symbols to Visual Studio when you're debugging. Obviously the source code is decompiled code rather than the actual source but it can be very helpful none the less for those times when the normal MS symbol servers aren't giving you the pdbs you need.
